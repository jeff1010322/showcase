I am creating this personal site to test out [Docusaurus v2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/)
and potentially serve as a place for me showcase some of the personal projects I am working on.

So far I have simply followed the tutorial to scaffold this website, cleaned it up and added some personal info, and updated the theme a bit.

Next step is to test out deployment with [Github Pages](https://docusaurus.io/docs/deployment#deploying-to-github-pages) followed
by updating to add more content and project examples.
